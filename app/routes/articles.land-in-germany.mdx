## Why Testmanship?

I started learning German, dreaming of a new life in Germany. I discovered opportunities such as apprenticeships that could help me get there. So I went to study German for a year and a half. Unfortunately, I was discouraged by the limited opportunities to do apprenticeships as a programmer. I read that apprenticeships in the IT field are mostly reserved for EU residents, or that I would need to be exceptionally fluent to land an apprenticeship and even then the competition is high. My German wasn't good enough for the programming field, but it would have been okay if I was pursuing a more menial job. So I decided to focus on the programming field and build my portfolio until I could land a job in Germany.

In the meantime, I'll just keep learning and creating until I elevate myself to a point where I can land a job in Germany. I'm sure I'll get there eventually. Well, maybe not exclusively in Germany. But anywhere in Europe would be a good place to start.

## Testmanship: Language Learning Hub

After completing Lotel, my android app, I sought to expand my portfolio by exploring new markets. Not to mention, there's hardly a demand for Flutter more so with Flutterflow developers overall. Upon considering the demand for language learning tools, I decided to create a platform that would help individuals track their progress in writing and speaking German. While Duolingo is an excellent resource for beginners, it has limitations when it comes to achieving fluency. I recognized an opportunity to fill this gap and provide a valuable service to language learners. I'm not saying that my project can replace Duolingo or strongly enhance fluency, but it has the potential to be a useful tool in addition to existing modes of learning. The education market is a significant and growing industry, and I wanted to explore its potential.

## The Future of Testmanship

I'm not finished with the project yet, I think there's still some work to be done or some features to be added. But I think it's a great project and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
