## Why Testmanship?

I started learning German, dreaming of a new life in Germany. I discovered opportunities such as apprenticeships that could help me get there. So I went to study German for a year and a half. Unfortunately, I was discouraged by the limited opportunities to do apprenticeships as a programmer. I read that apprenticeships are mostly reserved for German citizens, or that I would need to be exceptionally fluent to land an apprenticeship. My German wasn't good enough for the programming field, but it would have been okay if I was pursuing a more menial job. So I decided to focus on the programming field and build my portfolio until I could land a job in Germany.

In the meantime, I'll just keep learning and creating until I elevate myself to a point where I can land a job in Germany. I'm sure I'll get there eventually. Well, maybe not exclusively in Germany. But anywhere in Europe would be a good place to start.

## Testmanship Learning Language Hub

After creating Lotel, I had to think of what else I could create for my portfolio. Flutter in general might not even have demand in the job market because I don't see job listings for Flutter or Flutterflow. Then I remembered that there's a demand for learning the German language. I thought I'd try to create something that would help people track their progress in writing and speaking German, because Duolingo isn't there yet. I read from various sources that they haven't gotten to fluency yet with their German with just Duolingo, so I guess there's still a gap in the market. Education in itself is a big market, and I wanted to see if I could break into it.
