## How Was Applying For Salesforce Dev Jobs So Far
It has been about a month or less of searching. At this point, I'm not sure I'm going anywhere with this. I was optimistic about it, but I just couldn't land any interviews. I only got like 1 interview and the company didn't reach out again for the technical interview. I even studied flashcards on Remnote every day to prepare for my Salesforce certification exam and interviews.

## Market for Salesforce Developers
I've been up most nights reading on Reddit how to even land a job on Salesforce. Tech as a whole, people said that the market is shit right now. I didn't know what it meant honestly because I was thinking Salesforce is a different market and it's so niche and cool that only a few people know about it. Either with admin or dev roles, even for at least entry-level positions, which there aren't. It's like everyone wants to hire at least 3 years of experience. They say it's a numbers game but I don't really see how when there's like only very few listings out there. I think I've applied to all of them and received a few rejection responses, but mostly ignores. Like what else do I have to do to get in?


## Will I Still Pursue Salesforce?
I have been contemplating about this for a while now. And it has come to me that I am not going to be able to learn Salesforce and keep up with the market. I am going to have to pivot to a different tech stack. What I need right now, is a remote, or freelance work. I have been scanning and evaluating every possible tech stack that could be a low hanging fruit yet still very much in demand. Something that must be in almost in the same line of expertise and yet has more demand than Salesforce.

## What's Next
I think I might be able to break through and do some WFH work and grow. For the past few weeks, I have been so depressed and exhausted applying for Salesforce jobs and wondering if I am even amenable to working in office outside of my hometown. I'm just trying to figure out what's next. It became clear to me also that I shouldn't quit my current position or at least I have to show up in our family businesses although it's not a significant role or the role I would even dream of having, but I do have some interests to protect, so might as well only consider roles that are remote and flexible. And Salesforce jobs do not offer that kind of flexibility. Although, hopefully I get extremely skilled and lucky in the area of development.
