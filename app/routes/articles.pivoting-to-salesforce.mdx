## The Journey So Far
I didn't just wake up one day and decide to build apps in Flutterflow. I've been around the block a few times, learning technologies like Vue.js, Ruby on Rails, and even Flutter. I've been working on a few side projects, and I'm always learning and growing. I've been doing Flutterflow development for a year now and still am when I have some ideas that I want to work on. The latest tech stack I'm using is React, Next.js, and Supabase.

## Knowing Salesforce
As a dev, I didn't want to be a Salesforce admin. I wanted to jump right into Salesforce development with PD1. So I looked up some job descriptions on LinkedIn and other job boards and found descriptions that mentioned HTML and CSS, apart from LWC and Visualforce. I thought I'd be building separate apps, not just inside the Salesforce lightning platform. But nope.

I took a course on Udemy called "Pass your Platform Developer 1 certification exam with this course.Learn Apex, Visualforce,LWC, Lightning Aura Framework" and learned how to build Flows and Aura components. I also learned how to build Visualforce pages, which was a bit different from what I was used to. It's kinda like a mix of Javascript and HTML. Then I learned Lightning Web Components too. But none of this is about building an app outside of Salesforce. I thought I could just access data via API calls from Salesforce, which is actually possible to do so, and use it to build a React app. But nope. It's all inside Salesforce.

The gist is, it's all about data manipulation and I'm super new to this. It's like starting from scratch all over. It's also kinda like a CMS like Wordpress, but in this case it's a CRM.

I'm not gonna lie, it's been a bit of a shock to me. But I'm still super stoked to be learning this tech. I mean, I was all about building React apps because it seemed like a cool way to make a living. But from what I've read online, the market is hella saturated and I don't wanna be just another dev in the sea. I'm not getting any younger, so I figured I'd take a chance on something with less competition - and that something is Salesforce. Plus, the growth potential is huge. It's a bit of a gamble, but I'm hyped to see where this path takes me.

## What's Next
I'm almost done with that Udemy course and I've been reading up on Reddit. It seems like it would be smart to learn Salesforce Admin stuff too, since that's the foundation of why there are even Salesforce dev jobs. And I'll probably start trying to build my own Salesforce github project so that I have something to add to my portfolio.
